# Magnesium

Magnesium is a fast FFMPEG based video converter with a simple GUI. Designed for optimizing my collection of ShadowPlay screen recordings. 

Its existence is due solely to my desire to understand how the WinUi3 works.

Highly inspired by [Caesium by SaeraSoft](https://saerasoft.com/caesium/#contacts).
